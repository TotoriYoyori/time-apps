# Time-Apps
Creating a multi-function time application that allows user to do four things:

## Global Clock
The clock should allows user to view time at different places in the world.

## Stopwatch
The clock will constantly tick up and allows user to measure the duration of event. 

## Timer
The clock will set a time that will tick down, acting as a reminder of remaining duration.

## Alarm
The clock will set a time in the background, and then ring once the time is reached.
